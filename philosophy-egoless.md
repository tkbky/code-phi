**The Ten Commandments of Egoless Programming**

"The Ten Commandments of Egoless Programming" were originally established in Jerry Weinberg’s book _The Psychology of Computer Programming_. These principles offer guidance for developers working in a collaborative environment, emphasising a mindset focused on the code and the team rather than individual ego. The human principles of software discussed in this context are considered timeless.

Here are the ten commandments and their practical implications:

1.  **Understand and accept that you will make mistakes.** The objective is to find mistakes early, before they make it into production. Mistakes are rarely fatal in the software industry, so one should learn, laugh, and move on from them.
2.  **You are not your code.** Remember that the entire point of a review is to find problems, and problems _will_ be found. Do not take it personally when a problem in the code is uncovered.
3.  **No matter how much “karate” you know, someone else will always know more.** Such an individual can teach you new things if you ask. **Seek and accept input from others, especially when you think it’s not needed**.
4.  **Don’t rewrite code without consultation.** There is a fine line between “fixing code” and “rewriting code”. **Understand the difference and pursue stylistic changes within the framework of a code review**, rather than acting as a lone enforcer.
5.  **Treat people who know less than you with respect, deference, and patience.** Avoid reinforcing the negative stereotype that developers are prima donnas or crybabies through anger and impatience.
6.  **The only constant in the world is change.** Be open to change and accept it with a smile. **Look at each change to requirements, platform, or tools as a new challenge**, not an inconvenience.
7.  **The only true authority stems from knowledge, not from position.** Knowledge engenders authority, and authority engenders respect. If you want respect in an egoless environment, cultivate knowledge.
8.  **Fight for what you believe, but gracefully accept defeat.** Understand that sometimes your ideas will be overruled. Even if you turn out to be right later, do not take revenge or say “I told you so” more than minimally, and do not make your overruled idea a martyr or rallying cry.
9.  **Don’t be “the guy in the room.”** Avoid isolating yourself in a dark office, emerging only for necessities. The isolated programmer is out of touch, out of sight, and out of control and has no place in an open, collaborative environment.
10. **Critique code instead of people – be kind to the coder, not to the code.** As much as possible, make all comments positive and oriented towards improving the code. Relate comments to local standards, program specifications, increased performance, etc..
