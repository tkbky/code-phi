**What are the SOLID Principles?**

SOLID is a mnemonic acronym representing five design principles in software programming. These principles are intended to make object-oriented designs **more understandable, flexible, and maintainable**. They can also serve as a core philosophy for methodologies like agile development or adaptive software development. The collection of principles was introduced by software engineer Robert C. Martin in a 2000 paper, and the acronym was coined by Michael Feathers around 2004.

Here are the five principles and their core ideas:

- **S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

  - **Principle:** A class should have **only one responsibility**. Stated differently, "there should never be more than one reason for a class to change".
  - **Importance:**
    - **Maintainability:** Classes with a single, well-defined responsibility are easier to understand and modify.
    - **Testability:** It's easier to write unit tests for classes with a single focus.
    - **Flexibility:** Changes related to one responsibility do not affect unrelated parts of the system.
  - _Note:_ The CUPID source offers a contrasting view, describing SRP as an "inside-out perspective" focused on code organisation, which it argues can create "artificial seams" and "administrative chores," sometimes preventing more natural separations from emerging.

- **O - Openâ€“closed Principle (OCP)**

  - **Principle:** Software entities (like classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be **open for extension, but closed for modification**.
  - **Importance:**
    - **Extensibility:** New features can be added without altering existing, tested code.
    - **Stability:** Reduces the risk of introducing bugs when making changes.
    - **Flexibility:** Adapts to changing requirements more easily.

- **L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

  - **Principle:** Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be **able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it**. This relates to the concept of design by contract.
  - **Importance:**
    - **Polymorphism:** Enables the effective use of polymorphic behaviour, making code more flexible and reusable.
    - **Reliability:** Ensures that subclasses adhere to the contract defined by their superclass.
    - **Predictability:** Guarantees that replacing a superclass object with a subclass object will not break the program.

- **I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

  - **Principle:** Clients should **not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use**.
  - **Importance:**
    - **Decoupling:** Reduces dependencies between classes, leading to more modular and maintainable code.
    - **Flexibility:** Allows for more targeted and specific implementations of interfaces.
    - **Avoids unnecessary dependencies:** Clients only need to know about the methods relevant to them.

- **D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
  - **Principle:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should **depend upon abstractions**. Also, abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
  - **Importance:**
    - **Loose coupling:** Reduces dependencies between different modules, making the code more flexible and easier to test.
    - **Flexibility:** Allows for changes to lower-level implementations without affecting higher-level clients.
    - **Maintainability:** Makes code easier to understand and modify.
